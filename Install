Terminal-Based Install

The following instructions are for advanced users or for users who encountered problems during the Graphical Install. We have tested LibreOffice in a lot of distributions. It can be installed in all of them, so these instructions should work. If they don't work for you, we suggest you to follow these steps:

    Make sure you haven't a corrupt download. Do a checksum, or just try to download the package again.
    Make absolutely sure you are downloading the package that matches your system. Common errors include trying to install a 64bit package on a 32bit system, or trying to install an .rpm in a .deb based distribution (or the other way around).
    Make absolutely sure you have root or sudo privileges. If not, the installation will fail. Become root or use sudo.

So here is the detailed terminal-based way to install LibreOffice:

Unpack the Downloaded Archive via Terminal

Open a command line (e.g. Konsole, GNOME Terminal, XFCE Terminal etc.) and change to the location where you downloaded the tarball. Now we'll decompress and unpack the package file. You should type:

For the .deb:
```
$ tar zxvf LibreOffice_$version_Linux_x86-deb.tar.gz
```
